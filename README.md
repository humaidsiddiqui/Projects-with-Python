Welcome to Python Learning Projects! This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with Python programming by building logic and understanding syntax through hands-on practice. Purpose The goal of these projects is to:

Build strong logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Understand Python syntax and its core concepts. Gain hands-on experience by working on practical examples.

What You'll Find This repository includes:

Beginner-level Projects: Basic programs focusing on syntax and logical problem-solving (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions). Intermediate Projects: Programs involving file handling, API integration, and modular design. Advanced Projects: Challenges like implementing algorithms, data structures, and creating small applications. Key Concepts Covered Python basics: Variables, loops, conditionals. Working with functions and modules. File handling (reading/writing files). Object-oriented programming (OOP). Error handling and debugging.

How to Use Clone the repository: bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/humaidsiddiqui/Projects-with-Python.git Navigate to the desired project folder: bash Copy Edit cd project-name Run the Python script: Copy Edit python script_name.py
